            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Vienna Center for Experimental Economics (VCEE), University of Vienna. My research is centered on developing and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) as methodological innovations in experimental and behavioral economics. I explore how these advanced AI tools can transform the way social scientists collect and analyze data, with a focus on capturing the nuances of human reasoning and decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work proceeds along two primary tracks. The first focuses on <strong>text-as-data</strong>, 
                where I develop rigorous methods for using LLMs to classify and quantify unstructured text from experimental settings.
                 This research, which formed a core part of my doctoral dissertation at the University of Mannheim, 
                 aims to establish new standards for replicability and reliability in automated text analysis.
            </p>
             <p>
                The second track involves designing and deploying  <strong>LLM-powered chatbots as novel experimental tools</strong>. 
                This extends beyond simple data collection to creating interactive agents that can engage with human subjects for various purposes, 
                such as persuasion, eliciting strategic thought, probing personal narratives, and improving participant understanding 
                of complex instructions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://stateofcrypto.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Crypto</a> research initiative, exploring the societal impact of digital financial systems. Previously, I was a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.

                <p class="publication-meta"><em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em>, 2025 (joint with Andria Smith, Hunter P. van Wagoner, and Ksenia Keplinger).</p>
                <p class="publication-summary">
                    Teams that combine human intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI) have become indispensable for solving complex tasks 
                    in various decision-making contexts in modern organizations. However, the factors that contribute to AI convergence, where 
                    human team members align their decisions with those of their AI counterparts, still remain unclear. This study integrates 
                    signaling theory with self-determination theory to investigate how specific signals—such as signal fit, 
                    optional AI advice, and signal set congruence—affect employees' AI convergence in human–AI teams. 
                    Based on four experimental studies conducted in facial recognition and hiring contexts with approximately 
                    1100 participants, the findings highlight the significant positive impact of congruent signals from both 
                    human and AI team members on AI convergence. Moreover, providing an option for employees to solicit AI 
                    advice also enhances AI convergence; when AI signals are chosen by employees rather than forced 
                    upon them, participants are more likely to accept AI advice. This research advances knowledge on 
                     human–AI teaming by (1) expanding signaling theory into the human–AI team context; (2) 
                     developing a deeper understanding of AI convergence and its drivers in human–AI teams; 
                     (3) providing actionable insights for designing teams and tasks to optimize decision-making in 
                     high-stakes, uncertain environments; and (4) introducing facial recognition as an innovative context for human–AI teaming.

                 <p class="publication-summary">
                    The objective of this paper is to explore whether NFT investors represent a distinct cohort within the broader 
                    crypto investment sphere. Employing data from a public survey with global outreach, we first find that NFT 
                    owners are younger and possess, on average, a lower educational level than the general crypto population 
                    but a higher cryptocurrency knowledge. Second, there are no significant gender differences among NFT investors 
                    and non-NFT investors, but those working in the crypto sphere are more likely to invest in NFTs. Additionally, 
                    individuals involved in yield farming or using crypto derivatives are more likely to own NFTs. Finally, we 
                    show that individuals with more concerns about the potential misuse of cryptocurrency for illicit activities are 
                    less likely to engage in the ownership of NFTs.

                <p class="publication-summary">
                   This study explores how communication within teams shapes individual reasoning and decision-making in strategic environments. 
                   We build on a structured intra-team communication protocol that allows for clean attribution of reasoning to 
                   individual participants by capturing their initial suggestions, exchanged messages, and final decisions. 
                   By analyzing this communication, we identify persuasion mechanisms and strategic thinking processes within teams. 
                   The study also compares this method to alternatives like "thinking aloud" and advice-giving, 
                   and highlights the advantages of using large language models for classifying participants' 
                   reasoning. Our results show that LLMs such as GPT-4 can reliably replicate human annotation 
                   for classifying levels of strategic sophistication, offering a scalable and 
                   replicable tool for analyzing reasoning in behavioral experiments.

                <p class="publication-summary">
                    This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) for text classification. 
                    We investigate whether original instructions can be effectively repurposed as prompts with 
                    moderate changes to achieve classification results comparable to human-coded benchmarks. 
                    Additionally, we study the impact of two prompting techniques - providing a set of n classified examples (n-shot) 
                    and requiring a justification explanation (zero-shot Chain-of-Thought) - on classification performance. 
                    Using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we further examine the extent to which larger model size improves classification accuracy. 
                    To assess these factors, we classify text from four economic experiments, 
                    covering tasks with varying complexity and prevalence in pre-training data, 
                    providing insights into how task characteristics influence classification performance. 
                    We find that LLMs can accurately and cost-effectively classify text across these tasks 
                    and replicate human annotations well. Performance improves through n-shot prompting 
                    and we observe task-dependent gains from Chain-of-Thought prompting. 
                    Our findings offer guidance for integrating LLM-based text classification into social science research.

                <p class="publication-meta">(joint with Stefan P. Penczynski). Currently under peer review.</p>
                <p class="publication-summary">
                    Theoretical work by Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1998) has shown how strategic voting undermines the intuition that unanimous voting eliminates 
                    convictions of innocent defendants. We set up a level-k model of jury voting and experimentally investigate strategic thinking with an experimental
                    design that uses intra-team communication. Looking at juries using the unanimity rule, we show that the jury performance depends on the strategic 
                    sophistication of jury members, which in turn depends on the complexity of the task at hand.
